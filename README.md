# Cutvalue-Optimization-recently-done-with-Mu2e-Flavor-Group
Optimization of a combination of cuts for both deposit energy and dE/dx in the Mu2e straw detector's particle identification system : : Usage of machine learning algorithm templates on TMVA | ROOT to develop training scripts that simultaneously maximize signal (electron) efficiency and background (proton) rejection : :  A sneak at the surprising lack of expected distinction between dE/dx data of electrons and muons obtained from a model Mu2e experiment.
